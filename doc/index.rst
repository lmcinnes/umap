UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction
===========================================================================

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimension reduction
technique that can be used for visualisation similarly to t-SNE, but also for
general non-linear dimension reduction. The algorithm is founded on three
assumptions about the data

1. The data is uniformly distributed on Riemannian manifold;
2. The Riemannian metric is locally constant (or can be approximated as such);
3. The manifold is locally connected.

From these assumptions it is possible to model the manifold with a fuzzy
topological structure. The embedding is found by searching for a low dimensional
projection of the data that has the closest possible equivalent fuzzy
topological structure.

The details for the underlying mathematics can be found in
`our paper on ArXiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426>`_:

**Installation**

Conda install, via the excellent work of the conda-forge team:

.. code:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge umap-learn

The conda-forge packages are available for linux, OS X, and Windows 64 bit.

PyPI install, presuming you have numba and sklearn and all its requirements
(numpy and scipy) installed:

.. code:: bash

    pip install umap-learn
