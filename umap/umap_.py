    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data to be modelled as a fuzzy simplicial set.

    n_neighbors: int
        The number of neighbors to use to approximate geodesic distance.
        Larger numbers induce more global estimates of the manifold that can
        miss finer detail, while smaller values will focus on fine manifold
        structure to the detriment of the larger picture.

    random_state: numpy RandomState or equivalent
        A state capable being used as a numpy random state.

    metric: string or function (optional, default 'euclidean')
        The metric to use to compute distances in high dimensional space.
        If a string is passed it must match a valid predefined metric. If
        a general metric is required a function that takes two 1d arrays and
        returns a float can be provided. For performance purposes it is
        required that this be a numba jit'd function. Valid string metrics
        include:
            * euclidean (or l2)
            * manhattan (or l1)
            * cityblock
            * braycurtis
            * canberra
            * chebyshev

            * sqeuclidean
            * yule
            * wminkowski

        Metrics that take arguments (such as minkowski, mahalanobis etc.)
        can have arguments passed via the metric_kwds dictionary. At this
        time care must be taken and dictionary elements must be ordered
        appropriately; this will hopefully be fixed in the future.

    metric_kwds: dict (optional, default {})
        Arguments to pass on to the metric, such as the ``p`` value for
        Minkowski distance.

    knn_indices: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors) (optional)
        If the k-nearest neighbors of each point has already been calculated
        you can pass them in here to save computation time. This should be
        an array with the indices of the k-nearest neighbors as a row for
        each data point.

    knn_dists: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors) (optional)
        If the k-nearest neighbors of each point has already been calculated
        you can pass them in here to save computation time. This should be
        an array with the distances of the k-nearest neighbors as a row for
        each data point.

    angular: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to use angular/cosine distance for the random projection
        forest for seeding NN-descent to determine approximate nearest
        neighbors.

    set_op_mix_ratio: float (optional, default 1.0)
        Interpolate between (fuzzy) union and intersection as the set operation
        used to combine local fuzzy simplicial sets to obtain a global fuzzy
        simplicial sets. Both fuzzy set operations use the product t-norm.
        The value of this parameter should be between 0.0 and 1.0; a value of
        1.0 will use a pure fuzzy union, while 0.0 will use a pure fuzzy
        intersection.

    local_connectivity: int (optional, default 1)
        The local connectivity required -- i.e. the number of nearest
        neighbors that should be assumed to be connected at a local level.
        The higher this value the more connected the manifold becomes
        locally. In practice this should be not more than the local intrinsic
        dimension of the manifold.

    verbose: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to report information on the current progress of the algorithm.

    Returns
    -------
    fuzzy_simplicial_set: coo_matrix
        A fuzzy simplicial set represented as a sparse matrix. The (i,

        The size of local neighborhood (in terms of number of neighboring
        sample points) used for manifold approximation. Larger values
        result in more global views of the manifold, while smaller
        values result in more local data being preserved. In general
        values should be in the range 2 to 100.

    n_components: int (optional, default 2)
        The dimension of the space to embed into. This defaults to 2 to
        provide easy visualization, but can reasonably be set to any
        integer value in the range 2 to 100.

    metric: string or function (optional, default 'euclidean')
        The metric to use to compute distances in high dimensional space.
        If a string is passed it must match a valid predefined metric. If
        a general metric is required a function that takes two 1d arrays and
        returns a float can be provided. For performance purposes it is
        required that this be a numba jit'd function. Valid string metrics
        include:
            * euclidean
            * manhattan
            * chebyshev
            * minkowski
            * canberra
            * braycurtis
            * mahalanobis
            * wminkowski
            * seuclidean

        Metrics that take arguments (such as minkowski, mahalanobis etc.)
        can have arguments passed via the metric_kwds dictionary. At this
        time care must be taken and dictionary elements must be ordered
        appropriately; this will hopefully be fixed in the future.

    n_epochs: int (optional, default None)
        The number of training epochs to be used in optimizing the
        low dimensional embedding. Larger values result in more accurate
        embeddings. If None is specified a value will be selected based on
        the size of the input dataset (200 for large datasets, 500 for small).

    learning_rate: float (optional, default 1.0)
        The initial learning rate for the embedding optimization.

    init: string (optional, default 'spectral')
        How to initialize the low dimensional embedding. Options are:
            * 'spectral': use a spectral embedding of the fuzzy 1-skeleton
            * 'random': assign initial embedding positions at random.
            * A numpy array of initial embedding positions.

    min_dist: float (optional, default 0.1)
        The effective minimum distance between embedded points. Smaller values
        will result in a more clustered/clumped embedding where nearby points
        on the manifold are drawn closer together, while larger values will
        result on a more even dispersal of points. The value should be set
        relative to the ``spread`` value, which determines the scale at which
        embedded points will be spread out.

    spread: float (optional, default 1.0)
        The effective scale of embedded points. In combination with ``min_dist``
        this determines how clustered/clumped the embedded points are.

    set_op_mix_ratio: float (optional, default 1.0)
        Interpolate between (fuzzy) union and intersection as the set operation
        used to combine local fuzzy simplicial sets to obtain a global fuzzy
        simplicial sets. Both fuzzy set operations use the product t-norm.
        The value of this parameter should be between 0.0 and 1.0; a value of
        1.0 will use a pure fuzzy union, while 0.0 will use a pure fuzzy
        intersection.

    local_connectivity: int (optional, default 1)
        The local connectivity required -- i.e. the number of nearest
        neighbors that should be assumed to be connected at a local level.
        The higher this value the more connected the manifold becomes
        locally. In practice this should be not more than the local intrinsic
        dimension of the manifold.

    repulsion_strength: float (optional, default 1.0)
        Weighting applied to negative samples in low dimensional embedding
        optimization. Values higher than one will result in greater weight
        being given to negative samples.

    negative_sample_rate: int (optional, default 5)
        The number of negative samples to select per positive sample
        in the optimization process. Increasing this value will result
        in greater repulsive force being applied, greater optimization
        cost, but slightly more accuracy.

    transform_queue_size: float (optional, default 4.0)
        For transform operations (embedding new points using a trained model_
        this will control how aggressively to search for nearest neighbors.
        Larger values will result in slower performance but more accurate
        nearest neighbor evaluation.

    a: float (optional, default None)
        More specific parameters controlling the embedding. If None these
        values are set automatically as determined by ``min_dist`` and
        ``spread``.
    b: float (optional, default None)
        More specific parameters controlling the embedding. If None these
        values are set automatically as determined by ``min_dist`` and
        ``spread``.

    random_state: int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default: None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    metric_kwds: dict (optional, default None)
        Arguments to pass on to the metric, such as the ``p`` value for
        Minkowski distance. If None then no arguments are passed on.

    angular_rp_forest: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to use an angular random projection forest to initialise
        the approximate nearest neighbor search. This can be faster, but is
        mostly on useful for metric that use an angular style distance such
        as cosine, correlation etc. In the case of those metrics angular forests
        will be chosen automatically.

    target_n_neighbors: int (optional, default -1)
        The number of nearest neighbors to use to construct the target simplcial
        set. If set to -1 use the ``n_neighbors`` value.

    target_metric: string or callable (optional, default 'categorical')
        The metric used to measure distance for a target array is using supervised
        dimension reduction. By default this is 'categorical' which will measure
        distance in terms of whether categories match or are different. Furthermore,
        if semi-supervised is required target values of -1 will be trated as
        unlabelled under the 'categorical' metric. If the target array takes
        continuous values (e.g. for a regression problem) then metric of 'l1'
        or 'l2' is probably more appropriate.

    target_metric_kwds: dict (optional, default None)
        Keyword argument to pass to the target metric when performing
        supervised dimension reduction. If None then no arguments are passed on.

    target_weight: float (optional, default 0.5)
        weighting factor between data topology and target topology. A value of
        0.0 weights entirely on data, a value of 1.0 weights entirely on target.
        The default of 0.5 balances the weighting equally between data and target.

    transform_seed: int (optional, default 42)
        Random seed used for the stochastic aspects of the transform operation.
        This ensures consistency in transform operations.

    verbose: bool (optional, default False)
        Controls verbosity of logging.
