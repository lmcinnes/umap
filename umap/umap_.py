    locally approximating geodesic distance at each point, creating a fuzzy
    simplicial set for each such point, and then combining all the local
    fuzzy simplicial sets into a global one via a fuzzy union.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data to be modelled as a fuzzy simplicial set.

    n_neighbors: int
        The number of neighbors to use to approximate geodesic distance.
        Larger numbers induce more global estimates of the manifold that can
        miss finer detail, while smaller values will focus on fine manifold
        structure to the detriment of the larger picture.

    random_state: numpy RandomState or equivalent
        A state capable being used as a numpy random state.

    metric: string or function (optional, default 'euclidean')
        The metric to use to compute distances in high dimensional space.
        If a string is passed it must match a valid predefined metric. If
        a general metric is required a function that takes two 1d arrays and
        returns a float can be provided. For performance purposes it is
        required that this be a numba jit'd function. Valid string metrics
        include:
            * euclidean
            * manhattan
            * chebyshev
            * minkowski
            * canberra
            * braycurtis
            * mahalanobis

            * sokalmichener
            * sokalsneath
            * yule
        Metrics that take arguments (such as minkowski, mahalanobis etc.)
        can have arguments passed via the metric_kwds dictionary. At this
        time care must be taken and dictionary elements must be ordered
        appropriately; this will hopefully be fixed in the future.

    metric_kwds: dict (optional, default {})
        Arguments to pass on to the metric, such as the ``p`` value for
        Minkowski distance.

    angular: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to use angular/cosine distance for the random projection
        forest for seeding NN-descent to determine approximate nearest
        neighbors.

    set_op_mix_ratio: float (optional, default 1.0)
        Interpolate between (fuzzy) union and intersection as the set operation
        used to combine local fuzzy simplicial sets to obtain a global fuzzy
        simplicial sets. Both fuzzy set operations use the product t-norm.
        The value of this parameter should be between 0.0 and 1.0; a value of
        1.0 will use a pure fuzzy union, while 0.0 will use a pure fuzzy
        intersection.

    local_connectivity: int (optional, default 1)
        The local connectivity required -- i.e. the number of nearest
        neighbors that should be assumed to be connected at a local level.
        The higher this value the more connected the manifold becomes
        locally. In practice this should be not more than the local intrinsic
        dimension of the manifold.

    verbose: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to report information on the current progress of the algorithm.

    Returns
    -------
    fuzzy_simplicial_set: coo_matrix
        A fuzzy simplicial set represented as a sparse matrix. The (i,

    Finds a low dimensional embedding of the data that approximates
    an underlying manifold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors: float (optional, default 15)
        The size of local neighborhood (in terms of number of neighboring
        sample points) used for manifold approximation. Larger values
        result in more global views of the manifold, while smaller
        values result in more local data being preserved. In general
        values should be in the range 2 to 100.

    n_components: int (optional, default 2)
        The dimension of the space to embed into. This defaults to 2 to
        provide easy visualization, but can reasonably be set to any
        integer value in the range 2 to 100.

    metric: string or function (optional, default 'euclidean')
        The metric to use to compute distances in high dimensional space.
        If a string is passed it must match a valid predefined metric. If
        a general metric is required a function that takes two 1d arrays and
        returns a float can be provided. For performance purposes it is
        required that this be a numba jit'd function. Valid string metrics
        include:
            * euclidean
            * manhattan
            * chebyshev
            * minkowski
            * canberra
            * braycurtis
            * mahalanobis
            * wminkowski
            * seuclidean
            * cosine
            * correlation
            * haversine
            * hamming
            * jaccard
            * dice
            * russelrao
            * kulsinski
            * rogerstanimoto
            * sokalmichener
            * sokalsneath
            * yule
        Metrics that take arguments (such as minkowski, mahalanobis etc.)
        can have arguments passed via the metric_kwds dictionary. At this
        time care must be taken and dictionary elements must be ordered
        appropriately; this will hopefully be fixed in the future.

    negative_sample_rate: int (optional, default 5)
        The number of negative edge/1-simplex samples to use per positive 
        edge/1-simplex sample in optimizing the low dimensional embedding.
        
    alpha: float (optional, default 1.0)
        The initial learning rate for the embedding optimization.

    init: string (optional, default 'spectral')
        How to initialize the low dimensional embedding. Options are:
            * 'spectral': use a spectral embedding of the fuzzy 1-skeleton
            * 'random': assign initial embedding positions at random.
            * A numpy array of initial embedding positions.

    min_dist: float (optional, default 0.1)
        The effective minimum distance between embedded points. Smaller values
        will result in a more clustered/clumped embedding where nearby points
        on the manifold are drawn closer together, while larger values will
        result on a more even dispersal of points. The value should be set
        relative to the ``spread`` value, which determines the scale at which
        embedded points will be spread out.

    spread: float (optional, default 1.0)
        The effective scale of embedded points. In combination with ``min_dist``
        this determines how clustered/clumped the embedded points are.

    set_op_mix_ratio: float (optional, default 1.0)
        Interpolate between (fuzzy) union and intersection as the set operation
        used to combine local fuzzy simplicial sets to obtain a global fuzzy
        simplicial sets. Both fuzzy set operations use the product t-norm.
        The value of this parameter should be between 0.0 and 1.0; a value of
        1.0 will use a pure fuzzy union, while 0.0 will use a pure fuzzy
        intersection.

    local_connectivity: int (optional, default 1)
        The local connectivity required -- i.e. the number of nearest
        neighbors that should be assumed to be connected at a local level.
        The higher this value the more connected the manifold becomes
        locally. In practice this should be not more than the local intrinsic
        dimension of the manifold.

    gamma: float (optional, default 1.0)
        Weighting applied to negative samples in low dimensional embedding
        optimization. Values higher than one will result in greater weight
        being given to negative samples.

    bandwidth: float (optional, default 1.0)
        The effective bandwidth of the kernel if we view the algorithm as
        similar to Laplacian eigenmaps. Larger values induce more
        connectivity and a more global view of the data, smaller values
        concentrate more locally.

    a: float (optional, default None)
        More specific parameters controlling the embedding. If None these
        values are set automatically as determined by ``min_dist`` and
        ``spread``.
    b: float (optional, default None)
        More specific parameters controlling the embedding. If None these
        values are set automatically as determined by ``min_dist`` and
        ``spread``.

    random_state: int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default: None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    metric_kwds: dict (optional, default {})
        Arguments to pass on to the metric, such as the ``p`` value for
        Minkowski distance.

    angular_rp_forest: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to use an angular random projection forest to initialise
        the approximate nearest neighbor search. This can be faster, but is
        mostly on useful for metric that use an angular style distance such
        as cosine, correlation etc. In the case of those metrics angular forests
        will be chosen automatically.

    verbose: bool (optional, default False)
        Controls verbosity of logging.
