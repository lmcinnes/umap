UMAP as a Feature Extraction Technique for Classification
---------------------------------------------------------

The following script shows how UMAP can be used as a feature extraction
technique to improve the accuracy on a classification task. It also shows
how UMAP can be integrated in standard scikit-learn pipelines.

The first step is to create a dataset for a classification task, which is
performed with the function ``sklearn.datasets.make_classification``. The
dataset is then split into a training set and a test set using the
``sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`` function.

Second, a linear SVM is fitted on the training set. To choose the best
hyperparameters automatically, a gridsearch is performed on the training set.
The performance of the model is then evaluated on the test set with the
accuracy metric.

 Third, the previous step is repeated with a slight modification: UMAP is
 used as a feature extraction technique. This small change results in a
 substantial improvement compared to the model where raw data is used.
